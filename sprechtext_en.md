## Hello
Hi, my topic is:
“Exploring possibilities for 2-butanol production in A. woodii by exchange of the Adh4 promoter”.

And today I’ll show you how I tried to produce 2-butanol in A. woodii using a genetic approach – and why that matters.

## Slide 1
This project focuses on the recombinant production of 2-butanol – a promising biofuel with higher energy density than ethanol.
Since microbial production is still limited, genetic engineering is used to increase yields.
By linking it to the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, CO₂ can be used as a carbon source – making the process more sustainable.

## Slide 2
Acetobacterium woodii is an anaerobic, acetogenic bacterium that fixes CO₂ via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway and produces acetyl-CoA.
In theory, it could be used to produce 2-butanol – but the synthesis is energetically challenging.
Still, A. woodii is a great chassis: it grows well under anaerobic conditions, it’s robust, genetically accessible, and doesn’t form harmful byproducts – making it a safe and interesting organism for biotechnology.
